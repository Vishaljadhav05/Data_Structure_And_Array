=> Data Structure & Arrays in Java

=> Data Structure :-

-> A data structure is a particular way by which we organize, manage and store the data in the computer so that it can be used effectively.
-> Data structure is not a programming langaue like c, c++, java or python. It is a set of algorithms 
    which we can implment in any programming langauges.

-> Operations that we can perform on data :-
    1. Searching
    2. Sorting
    3. Insertion
    4. Deletion
    5. Updation


-> Advantages :-
    1. We can process the data easily
    2. It stores the data very efficiently on the disk
    3. Data structure is used to develop algorithms
    4. It stores the data in a secured way

1. Primitive Data Structure (eg Integer, Float, Long, Double etc)

2. Non-Primitive Data Structure

    -> Linear DS (eg String, Files, Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues etc)
    = In Linear DS the data is arranged in a sequential form i.e. one element is connected to only one other element in linear form.

    -> Non-Linear DS (eg Graphs & Trees)
    = In non-linear DS, one element can connect with 'n' number of elements.

=> Arrays :-

1. Array is a collection of similar type of data (homogeneous data)
2. Array elements are stored in contigeous memory locations
3. Array can contain primitive or non-primitive elements
4. Array is index based data structure, first index position of an array is 0
5. Array length starts from 1
